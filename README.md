# GithubProfileManager

  This is a web aplication made with ReactJS that could be used for management of Github profiles. For the sake of the app I've created 3 dummy profiles here on Github, if you search those profiles by their names here you can see that by making changes to their user info in the application the changes are applied in real time here on Github. 
  An example of how this app can be used otherwise is if you give to the profile tokens the permissions to make changes to the repositories of the profiles instead of the user info(as I have done), then one employee of a company could manage the repositories of all the other workers and coordinate them, commit changes to the repos etc.(it would be usefull to the project manager).
